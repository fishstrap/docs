<Card title="Is fishstrap.com official?" icon="magnifier">
    No, fishstrap.com is not the official website. The only real website is [fishstrap.app](https://fishstrap.app). The only place to get Fishstrap from is either the Github or the official website.
</Card>
<Card title="Is Fishstrap Malware?" icon="magnifier">
    No, Fishstrap is **NOT** malware. The code for the app can be publicly viewed on [Github](https://github.com/Fishstrap/Fishstrap). Antivirus software may flag it as malware, but rest assured that it is not.
</Card>
<Card title="Can using Fishstrap get me banned?" icon="magnifier">
    No, it's impossible for Fishstrap to get you banned. We do not interact with the roblox process in any possible way that could lead to a ban.

    Additionally, Roblox themselves has made a statement about this issue:

<Card title="Does Fishstrap increase my FPS?" icon="magnifier">
    No, Fishstrap does not increase your FPS, nor is it an FPS booster. Any tool claiming to "boost your FPS" is likely lying to you.
</Card>
<Card title="What happened to my FastFlags?" icon="magnifier">
    <Aside type="danger">Do not download any program that claims to let you use custom Flags. It will most likely get you banned/hacked.</Aside>

    Due to a Roblox update, FastFlags can no longer be modified on the Roblox player client (The one you use to play games). The only FastFlags you can use are the ones Roblox permits you to use. You can view the list of Flags on [this devforum page](https://devforum.roblox.com/t/allowlist-for-local-client-configuration-via-fast-flags/3966569).
