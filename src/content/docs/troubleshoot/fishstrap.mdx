## ```"[System.IO.FileNotFoundException](System.IO.FileNotFoundException: Could not load file or assembly..."```

#### Causes

- Missing .NET Desktop Runtime 6.0  
- Corrupted or incomplete .NET installation
    
#### Solution
    
<Steps>
    1. **Check installed runtimes**:  
       Open Command Prompt and run:
       <Code title="pwsh" code="dotnet --list-runtimes" lang="bash" />
       Look for `Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App 6.0.x`. If missing, the runtime isn’t installed correctly.
    
    2. **Install .NET Desktop Runtime 6.0**:  
       Download and install **.NET Desktop Runtime 6.0** (not just ".NET Runtime") from:  
       [https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0)
</Steps>

## ```"System.Net.Http.HttpRequestException:..."```

#### Causes:
- Roblox is down.
- Using a VPN, Cloudflare WARP, or proxy.
- Government censorship or network restrictions.
- Incorrect Deployment settings in Fishstrap

#### Solution
<Steps>
    1. **Check if Roblox is working** by visiting the [roblox status](https://status.roblox.com/) page.
    2. **Disable/Enable VPNs, or proxies**: Check if the issue persists after you disable/enable your VPN.
    3. **Check Deployment settings**:
       In Fishstrap, go to the **Deployment** tab → Set **Channel** to `Production` and **Automatic channel change action** to **“Never change”**.
</Steps>

## FFlags are not working

#### Causes:

- Using flags not on Roblox’s official allowlist  
- Expecting Studio behavior in the client

#### Solution:
1. **Only use allowlisted FastFlags in the client**:  
   As of late 2025, Roblox enforces a strict allowlist for client-side FastFlags.  
   See the [full list here](https://devforum.roblox.com/t/allowlist-for-local-client-configuration-via-fast-flags/3966569).

2. **Studio has no allowlist**:  
   All FastFlags still work in **Roblox Studio**, but **not in the client** unless explicitly allowed.

---

## Global settings tab is greyed out

#### Causes:

- Fishstrap hasn’t launched Roblox yet  
- Configuration not initialized

#### Solution:
1. **Launch any game through Fishstrap at least once** - this initializes internal settings.  
2. **Close Roblox and reopen the Fishstrap settings** - global settings should now be editable.

## Stuck on “Waiting for data…”

<Steps>
    1. **Click Cancel** on the loading screen.  
    2. **Rejoin the same game** — this usually resolves temporary asset loading issues.
</Steps>

## “The JSON you've entered does not appear to be valid.”

#### Causes:

- Incorrect JSON syntax  
- Misformatted FastFlag entries

#### Solution:
Use a JSON verification tool like [JSONLint](https://jsonlint.com/) to validate your JSON.
