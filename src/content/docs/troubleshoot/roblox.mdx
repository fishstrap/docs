## Roblox fails to launch or crashes immediately

#### Causes:
- Corrupted installation  
- Outdated graphics drivers  
- Conflicting third-party software (e.g., exploits)

#### Solution:
1. **Reinstall Roblox**:  
   Go to [Roblox.com](https://www.roblox.com), log in, and join any experience to trigger a fresh install.

2. **Update GPU drivers**:  
   - NVIDIA: [GeForce Experience](https://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx)  
   - AMD: [Adrenalin Software](https://www.amd.com/en/support)  
   - Intel: [Driver & Support Assistant](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/detect.html)

## Infinite loading screens

#### Causes:
- DNS or network filtering  
- Windows firewall blocking Roblox  
- Georestrictions (e.g., regional blocks in countries like Russia)
- A full drive

#### Solution:
1. **Flush DNS**:  
   Open Command Prompt as admin and run:
   ```bash
   ipconfig /flushdns
   netsh winsock reset
   ```
   Restart your PC afterward.

2. **Check firewall rules**:  
   Allow `RobloxPlayerBeta.exe` through Windows Defender Firewall.

3. **Check for regional restrictions**:  
   In some countries (e.g., Russia), Roblox may be blocked by local regulations. Search online to confirm availability in your region.

4. **Clear your drive**:
    Make sure your drive is not nearing maximum capacity. This is known to increase load times dramatically.
