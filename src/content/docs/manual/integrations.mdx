## Activity tracking

Activity tracking is a component of Fishstrap that lets it run in the background and detect what game you’re currently playing.

This is mainly used for:
    1. Discord Rich Presence
    2. Game history
    3. Server location

When it’s enabled, Fishstrap will stay running in the background while you’re playing, and it’ll show in your system tray. Right-clicking on the tray icon will bring up a menu where you can use its features.

Clicking “**Copy invite deeplink**” will copy a shareable invite link for your server to your clipboard. This link can be used by anyone with Roblox installed, even players who don’t have Fishstrap.

Some options may not be shown if you’re not currently in a game.

### Query server location

<Aside>You can only see the notification while your Roblox is in windowed/borderless mode. Fullscreen is not supported. Data shown may not always be accurate.</Aside>

When in-game, you'll be able to see where your server is located at via [ipinfo.to](https://ipinfo.io/).
