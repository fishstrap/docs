## Prompt to confirm closure when launching another Roblox instance

Fishstrap will prompt you when launching another instance of Roblox to confirm
whether you want to close the existing instance or cancel the launch of another
one.

## Background updates

<Aside type="note">
  This feature is not recommended for slow internet connections (such as Wi-Fi
  or mobile data) and requires at least 3 GB of free storage space to work.
</Aside>

Allows Fishstrap to download new versions of Roblox in the background while you
are playing. It will switch to a new Roblox version on the next launch.

## Cleaner

Fishstrap will automatically remove old data to save on space on your PC.

### When should the files get deleted

This option selects the cleaner's threshold for old files. Files older than the
selected threshold will be deleted on the next launch.

- **Never** disables the cleaner.
- **After 1 day**, **After 1 week**, **After 1 month** and **After 2 months**
  will enable the cleaner and set its threshold to 1 day, 1 week, 1 month and 2
  months respectively.

### Which files the cleaner can delete?

The cleaner only deletes these files you have enabled the toggle for:

- **Cache**: looks for old downloads.
- **Logs**: looks for old Roblox logs.
- **Fishstrap Logs**: looks for old Fishstrap logs.

Toggles and their respective paths are shown in the table below.

| Toggle         | Paths                                                              |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Cache          | `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Fishstrap\Downloads`, `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Temp\Roblox` |
| Logs           | `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Roblox\logs`                                       |
